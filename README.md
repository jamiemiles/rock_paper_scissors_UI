This project gave me a better understanding of the DOM and how Javascript can be used to influence it.

- I learned how to create animations using keyframes
- I learned how to link these keyframes to Javascipt and create animations based on event listeners
- I learned about event listeners and how they have the power to maniipulate the front-end based on user interaction
- I learned how to target nodes and manipulate their content using querySelector and querySelectorAll
- I learned about arrow functions however I still need to dive deeper into their purpose and why they are more beneficial over standard functions
- I learned how to use the Math.random() function to enable the computer to select an item from an array at random

Overall this was a really enjoyable task, it was difficult however I benefited alot from taking on this challenge as it forced me to get familiar with DOM manipulation.
